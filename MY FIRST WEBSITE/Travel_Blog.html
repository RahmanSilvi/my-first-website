    <h1><i>Dream Traveler</i></h1> 
    <div>
        <p>It’s a big wide world out there. A world of cultural charms and natural wonders; of mega-cities and remote outposts; of paths to cross and lessons to learn; of limitless kindness and harsh realities.</p>

        <p>We travel to enquire, to hear stories and to be awestruck by incredible scenery. To witness the ingenuity and defiance of individuals and the remarkable output of their cooperation. To be humbled by the history of yesterday, informed about the politics of today and excited by the possibilities of tomorrow.</p>

        <p>Anywhere We Roam is the story of our travels. The moments that moved us, the characters we encountered and the stage upon which it is all set.

            It’s a big wide world out there, come see it with us.</p>

    <span style="color: brown;"><b>This is all good for beginners but when these blogs grow, most bloggers forgot about design and instead doubled down on SEO and marketing, sometimes sacrificing user experience for profit. Their identities are diluted over time and hence why most of the travel blogs you see nowadays feel similar to one another.
