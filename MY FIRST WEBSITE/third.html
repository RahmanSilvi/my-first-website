    In this lecture I have learned heading, inline vs block. Also small tag.
</p>

<p>
    There are 6 type of heading. 
    <br>
    example:
    <h1>Abbu</h1>
    <h2>Ammu</h2>
    <h3>Shrovi</h3>
    <h4>Rafi</h4> 
    <h5>Silvi</h5>
    <h6>Mashhn</h6>
</p>

    Inline VS Block
    <br>
    An inline element does not start on a new line. An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary. For exsample: small tag, italic tag, emhasise tag, strong, bold etc.
    <br>
    <br>
    On the other hand A <b>block-level element</b> <strong>always starts on a new line</strong>, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin) before and after the element.
    A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
    <br>
    Two commonly used block elements are: paragraph <p> and division <div>.
    <br>
    The paragraph <p> element defines a paragraph in an HTML document.
    <br>
    The division <div> element defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
