    In todays second lectre I learned how to make a paragraph in html, how to <b>bold</b> a word or a sentense, how to <strong>strong</strong> a word, how to make a word <i>italic</i> and <em>emphasise</em> a word also.
</p>

<p>
    From todays lecture I also learn the basic difference of bold and strong, italic and emphasise. 
    <br> 
    <b>Strong</b> and <b>Emphasise</b> are the semantic tags. <strong>Semantic</strong> means something meaningful.
</p>

    Tags:
    <br>
    Bold : <b></b>
    Strong: <strong></strong>
    Italic: <i></i>
    Emphasise: <em></em>
